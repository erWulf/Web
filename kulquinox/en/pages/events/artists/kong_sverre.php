						<p>
							Kong Sverre aka Sverre Thorstensen began his career as a song creator only 15-years old.
						</p>
						<p>
						    We can probably thank Svein Haagenrud (formerly active football player and secretary general of the Norwegian Football Association) that Sverre got focused on the music.
							Haagenruds son, Svein Inge nicknamed Pill, ruled the junior team and later the A-team already as a boy player
							and Sverre was sitting at home and adding synth strings on the tracks from Michael Jackson's Bad and creating Norwegian texts.
						</p>
					    <p>
							He never understood what was so grand with fuzz guitars, and after recieving instruments from Folk &amp; RÃ¸vere, chilensk danseband, Penthouse Playboys og Snuten he began to create something that resembled the first pop music he heard.
						</p>
						<p>
							Kong Sverre has previously released two albums, Natur and Jazzelektro on his own label Roger Sunshine Records.
							Fugl (Beatservice 2009) is his latest album, which so far has been met with a collective cold shoulder from the national press.
							This has happened with Jan Guillou several times too, so it provides no reason for concern.
						</p>
					    <p>
							Even a king can have difficulties deciding, as the record contains both Norwegian and English lyrics, both misogynistic and women-friendly themes, good rhymes and bad rhymes from the king's hand.
