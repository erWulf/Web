								Haraldur Vignir Sveinbj√∏rnsson goes by the stage name Red Barnett.
								He began his music career very early, already as an 8 year old boy he started to record music on cassettes.
								
								His dream was to become a rock guitarist, and this dream was fulfilled in the band Dead Sea Apple, which he started in 1992. Dead Sea Apple was one of the biggest underground rock bands on Iceland in the early 90s.
								Dead Sea Apple has been more or less dead since the late 90s, but now they are rejoining to produce a new album.

								Haraldur visits Kulquinox as a solo artist, in a slightly less rocking version. As a solo artist Haraldur plays soft rock inspired by classical music.
