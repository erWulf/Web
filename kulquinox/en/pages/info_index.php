				<h3>Grassroot share</h3>
				<p>
					Will you give your support to the Cosmic Wind Cultural Collaborations(CWCC, org.nr. 991 534 474)?
				</p>
				<p>
					Grassroots share is an arrangement by the Norwegian National Lottery, where you as a registered player can choose one team or one club that you want to support - your grassroots receiver. We encourage you to support us in Cosmic Wind Cultural Collaborations!
				</p>
				<p>
					Imagine that you can play your favorite games - Lotto, Tipping or Joker, for example - while providing something more to the team or the organization you wish to support.
					This is now possible through grassroots share. When playing at the Norwegian Lottery, 5% of the bet go directly to your club or association (not including Extra and Flax).
					Note that Grasrotandelen do not in any way affecting the bet or your prize - you will not be charged anything to be a grassroots donor.
					You need the Norwegian Lottery Player Card to connect to grassroots share. Playing Cards are available from commissioner, or you can order it at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.Norsk-Tipping.no">www.norsk-tipping.no</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					We encourage you to connect to the system already, and you do it on one of the following ways:
				</p>
				<p>
					1. At the Commissioner: Bring org.nr 991 534 474 and your player card to one of the Norwegian Tipping many commissioners.
				</p>
